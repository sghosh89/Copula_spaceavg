Intro :

\lettrine{U}{}nderstanding the mechanisms behind spatial and temporal 
dynamics has been a long-standing focus in community ecology [@gibson2009; @turner1989].
Interspecies interaction in a grassland 
community could be advantageous or
disadvantageous to either or both species involved, 
which led to mutualism or competition
as the case might be. These inter-species response were 
found to be affected by several biotic and abiotic factors 
including climate, fire, soil-nutrients, pollinators, micorrhizae,
grazing and other form of disturbances 
[@mcnaughton1983; @parton1995; @bardgett2008; @belsky1992; 
@collins1992; @olff1998; @fry2017; @potts2003; @hudewenz2012;
@canals2003; @hallett2014].
Excessive pressure of any of those 
disturbances could alter the competitive balance in the community
and could shift the species-dominance affecting overall species richness and 
ecosystem-function. Most of the prior studies used, in general, the correlation 
or regression based approach to understand species-variability with other
species within a community (or with environmental variables) to establish causal
relationship and thereby lacking important information embedded in their joint
distribution structure.


We chose Jasper Ridge Biological
Preserve (JRBP), a biodiversity hotspot in californian serpentine grassland, as our study system. 
Long term observations in JRBP showed the serpentine grassland vary widely in its 
species composition both in temporal and spatial scale [@hobbs2007; @zhu2016]. 
Climate change and invasion by 
exotic species in JRBP had detrimental effect on native species shifting its dominance 
from one species to another
and thereby posing habitat loss of their
dependent species leading to extinction [@stromberg2007]. 
For example, bay-checkerspot butterfly 
\textit{Euphydryas editha bayensis} is now locally extinct at Jasper Ridge.
It may be due to declining abundance of its principal larval 
host plant \textit{Plantago erecta}
in competition with invasive species like \textit{Bromus hordeaceus}.
Jasper Ridge has been served as an experimental model system to 
study ecological hypothesis since long and proved to be effective
in decision making from conservation and management perspective. 

Our objective is to find the 
synchronous (for positively correlated variables)
or compensatory (for negatively correlated variables) dynamics in 
the serpentine grassland of JRBP and mixed-prairie of Hays in Kansas 
using "tail-dependence" feature of copula.
Using a model selection approach as well as nonparametric analysis, we try to
find is there any asymmetric tail-dependence in those grassland community and
if there is, then could this tail-dependence be explained depending on 
species-environment interactions? We also suggest an alternative measure of 
community variability in terms of quantifying skewness of total biomass over years.

Similar finding was also observed earlier
by Hobbs et al.[@hobbs1991] where several years of above-average rainfall 
led to an abundance in \textit{Bromus hordeaceus} and shifted the dominance 
among native annuals from \textit{Plantago Erecta} to \textit{Lasthenia Californica}.

Another multispecies interaction was native annual 
\textit{Vulpia microstachys} (sp42) 
found to show stronger lower tail dependence (positive correlation with
simultaneous low-abundance) with other two species \textit{Layia Platyglossa} (sp19)
and \textit{Castilleja densiflora} (sp30). 

================Results including growing season ppt. effect on jrg spatial avg data====================
Interestingly, we found
that annual and perennial showed different tolerance towards total precipitation 
for the growing season. For example, some extreme dry years [e.g. 2012 or 2014's 
drought [@griffin2014]]
with little precipitation made annual 
forb \textit{Castilleja densiflora} (sp30) uncommon whereas perennial forb 
\textit{Brodiaea spp.} (sp5)
became abundant at those years (see Fig. \ref{SI-fig_spaceavg_drought}). 
Earlier study [@pitt1978] showed years with "suboptimal" rainfall had relatively higher cover
of perennial forbs whereas years with "favorable" rainfall patterns promoted earlier
germination and better growth for annual grasses. Another perennial 
native bunchgrass \textit{Nassella pulchra} (sp36) became rare in the community with
low average temperature (considered as sp44)
during growing season for two successive years, showing lower tail-dependence.-->
