# Introduction\label{Introduction}

<!--p1: what is community stability? How it relates to species interaction? - 
2 types of interaction: synchronous: more variable or less stable, 
asynchronous/ compensatory: more stable, less variable.
Stability-variability relationship usually explained by cassic variance ratio method
-->

<!--diversity-stability relationship-->
Understanding the mechanism behind the stability of an ecosystem 
(be it on population or community level) has been intrigued the ecologists since 
long [@macarthur1955fluctuations; @paine1969note; 
@grimm1992application; @pimm1984complexity]. Theoretical and experimental 
studies indicated 'diversity-stability' relationship as a possible indicator to predict 
stability on community or ecosystem scale [@goodman1975theory; @tilman1994biodiversity; 
@doak1998statistical] though contradiction became apparent with few studies 
asking if diversity increases or decreases the community-stability [@mccann2000diversity].
@ives2007stability concluded 'diversity-stability' relationship is complex and cannot 
be explained without considering the effect of environmental drivers due to anthropogenic changes.

<!--variability-stability relationship-->
Another perspective to understand community-stability is to study the 'variability-stability' 
relationship [@wang2014ecosystem]. How species fluctuate with time 
and also how environmental fluctuation affects the species-interaction 
within the community help us to interprete whether the total productivity is consistent 
throughout times or not [@ives1999stability]. The change in total productivity with time 
is considered as one of the proxy to quantify community-stability [@grimm1992application].
This total productivity is influenced by two major types of species interaction - compensatory and 
synchronous. Compensatory dynamics mean when species are in competition 
such that decreases in one or more species-abundances are compensated 
by the increases in others so that the total productivity 
remains overall constant throughout years, making the community 
less variable and hence more stabilized [@frost1995species; @bai2004ecosystem; 
@gonzalez2009causes; @hallett2014]. Synchronous dynamics, on 
the other hand, arises when majority of species fluctuate
together in response to a common biotic/ abiotic driver 
so that the community shows high variability in total 
productivity and so considered as less stabilized [@keitt2008coherent; @loreau2008species; 
@ma2017climate].

<!--p2: what is variance ratio? How it is used to determine a community's variability?-->
Variance ratio, $\phi_{cv}$, is a commonly used stability-index that measures how 
community-variance changes compared to an independent community where each species 
fluctuate randomly. Community with lower variance than the 
independent one (i.e., $\phi_{cv}<1$), is considered 
to be more stable due to overall compensatory dynamics 
whereas a community with higher variance than 
the independent one (i.e., $\phi_{cv}>1$), is considered to be less stable due to 
overall synchronous fluctuations. Therefore, the variance ratio approach is based on 
if the species are negatively (compensation) or positively (synchronous) correlated 
among themselves within the community. An independent community means where 
species fluctuate randomly with zero correlation.

<!--p3: Though widely used, but this coeff. of variation or variance measure is not 
showing the full picture: what if skewness changes with same variance? Fig. 1-->
Although widely used, simple-correlation based variance ratio metric is not 
enough to predict the community-stability if the species show stronger 
correlation among themselves for certain years than others. For example, consider
two hypothetical communities with equal number of species. The only difference is 
in one community all the species have simultaneously low values in catastrophic years
(i.e. synchronous rare occurrence than being abundant, Fig. \ref{fig_pedag_cv2_skw}A) and in the 
other community all species have simultaneously high values in beneficial
years (i.e. synchronous abundance than being rare, Fig. \ref{fig_pedag_cv2_skw}B). 
The first community has higher risk to collapse at once whereas the second one maintains 
high productivity throughout years. But both communities would indicate
similar variance ratio because it assumes equal variance between 
interspecific fluctuations throughout years. We propose skewness instead using variance 
could be appropriate to make the distinction between two such communities. Simultaneous 
dip in the individual timeseries of Fig. \ref{fig_pedag_cv2_skw}A make the 
aggregated timeseries more negatively skewed (Fig. \ref{fig_pedag_cv2_skw}C) whereas 
simultaneous hike in the individual timeseries of Fig. \ref{fig_pedag_cv2_skw}B make the 
aggregated timeseries more positively skewed (Fig. \ref{fig_pedag_cv2_skw}D) compared to 
if the species were fluctuating randomly.

<!--p4: Following the arguments, we need an additional measure which 
could incorporate the "skewness changing" feature of the community. Fig 2(A-B): Box simple diagram.
Skewness has been found as an indicator even in the studies for 
early warning signal or regime shifts (citations)-->
Following the above argument, we need an additional measure which could 
incorporate the changing skewness feature of the community. 







<!--p5: But how skewness is different than variance-measure? Is there 
any mechanism working in the background that is responsible 
for changing skewness while keeping the overall correlation same? Therefore, we think may be it is "tail-association".(Fig. 2C-D)-->


<!--p6: What is tail-association? How it could chenge the skewness of the 
community on aggregated sp. level? and then relate it to the stability 
intuitively: LT association means crashing the whole community.-->


<!--p7: Our objectives:
(Q1) Could we find an overall tail association (L/U) in a community which arises because of  
synchronous/ compensatory species interaction? [answer by pscor]
(Q2) If we do, then how does tail-association pattern explain the underlying mechanism 
affecting the overall skewness of the community? More specifically, could this
assymetric sp. interaction explain the community stability which we might miss with the classic variance ratio method? [answer: Fig 1b hidden box revealed]

<!--NOTE: if you can, just separate theory and methods section.-->

<!--1. For Q1:
      - introduce partial Spearman correlation to measure tail asymmetry corl - coru (need schematic diagram)
      - corl - coru in community context, count on L, U (+ve correlation only)
      - binomial and significance testing: at present not shown-->

<!--Defining partial Spearman correlation: measure of tail-asymmetry-->
To answer Q1 from \nameref{Introduction}, we need a tool to measure the tail asymmetry between 
interacting species over years in a grassland community that is intended to study. We used 
the *partial Spearman correlation* approach (first introduced in @Ghosh_copula) to 
estimate the association between a pair of interacting species' time-series, i.e., whether 
they are strongly correlated in their common good/ bad years or 
one species abundance in certain 'good' years limits the growth for the 
other. First, we define the *partial Spearman correlaion* for a given 
species pair time series ($u(t), v(t)$) as follows;

\begin{equation}
\cor_{l_b,u_b}(u,v) = \frac{\sum (x(t)-\mean(x))(y(t)-\mean(y))}{(n-1)\sqrt{\var(x) \var(y)}},\label{PartialSpearmanEq}
\end{equation}
\noindent where $x$ and $y$ are the normalized ranks of 
$u$ and $v$, respectlively (see \nameref{Introduction}). Sample means 
and variances are computed using all the data but the sum is computed only
over the $t$ such that $x(t)+y(t) > 2l_b$ and $x(t)+y(t)<2u_b$ (i.e. colored data points lying in 
between two bounds as in Fig. \ref{fig_pedag_taildep}). The partial Spearman correlation, 
attributed by those colored data points between bounds, is the contribution in the Spearman
correlation of $u$ and $v$. For an asymmetric relationship 
between a species-pair, association in any part 
of their joint distribution of corresponding normalized ranks could 
be stronger than the other part. For example, Fig. \ref{fig_pedag_taildep}A has a 
stronger partial Spearman correlation between the red points in the lower portion 
than the blue points in the upper part, while Fig. \ref{fig_pedag_taildep}B shows 
the opposite trend. 


The quantity $\cor_{0,0.5}(u,v)-\cor_{0.5,1}(u,v)$ is a way to measure asymmetry of tail
associations between $u$ and $v$. It 
represents the amount by which partial Spearman correlation is stronger for the points lying in the lower half (i.e. 
below the diagonal dashed line $x+y=1$ in Fig. \ref{fig_pedag_taildep}) of the unit 
square than in the upper half. We will represent 
$\cor_{l}-\cor_{u}$ for the shorthand of $\cor_{0,0.5}(u,v)-\cor_{0.5,1}(u,v)$ here 
afterwards. A non-zero value of $\cor_{l}-\cor_{u}$ means tail-asymmetry between the time series of
two species - whether they are synchronizing over years or competing with each other. For synchronized 
species-pair, a positive $\cor_{l}-\cor_{u}$ value signifies stronger lower 
tail association (Fig. \ref{fig_pedag_taildep}A) of two 
positively correlated species, whereas a negative value means stronger
upper tail association (Fig. \ref{fig_pedag_taildep}B). Though the aforementioned notion of 
tail-asymmetry measure is constructed for positively correlated species pair keeping in mind, it 
is possible to extend the idea for negatively correlated species. When the species are competing, we can take any one species time series as negative (so that now species are positively correlated) and 
make a similar plot as in Fig. \ref{fig_pedag_taildep}A or B (depending on which species we are reversing). 
Species for reversal can be chosen arbitrarily, hence only the magnitude, not the sign of tail-asymmetry 
$\cor_{l}-\cor_{u}$ is considered for competing species pair. 

<!--corl - coru in community context, count on L, U (+ve correlation only)-->
From a community perspective, it is possible to determine if the community as a whole
shows asymmetric tail association and if yes then what is its underlying 
nature - overall lower tail or upper-tail asymmetry. To explore this, consider a 
community with $n$ number of species subdivided 
into three categories: *common* species (present for most of the years), *rare* 
species (only occurs once or twice) and the rest as *intermediate* ones. Throughout our study, 
we assume a $n$-species-community comprised of $T$-years long observations for $(n-1)$ *common* species 
and one *pseudo*-species (aggregated time-series of *rare* and *intermediate* categories). For
such community, there are $n(n-1)/2$ number of unique 
pair-wise interspecific interactions possible. First, for 
each of these species-pairs, we construct the scatter plots with 
the normalized rank of corresponding time-series 
<!-- omitted as of now: 
and test their 
independence using `BiCopIndTest` function from `VineCopula` package implemented in `R`. If 
independence is rejected ($0.05$ significance level), then we proceed to estimate--> 
and measured tail-asymmetry ($\cor_{l}-\cor_{u}$) as described above. For positively 
correlated species-pair, we count how many are with the stronger 
lower-tail (or upper-tail) association, $n_L$ (or $n_U$). These 
numbers along with the sum of tail-asymmetry values, $A_{tot} (= \sum \cor_{l}-\cor_{u})$ for those species-pair 
can give us an idea about the overall nature of tail-asymmetry within the community.

<!--omitted as of now: Significance tests for individual and overall asymmetry, tailsignif.R, binomial_sigtest.R
At present not shown, because we want to consider all interactions: weekest to strongest.

Tail-asymmetry could be weaker on individual species-pair, but on an aggregate level can make 
the community strongly tail-asymmetric. To test significantly stronger 
association in one of its extreme tail for a given species-pair, we simulate $10000$ made-up 
species pair with same Spearman correlation but removing their tail-asymmetry. If 
estimated tail-asymmetry $\cor_{l}-\cor_{u}$ on given data lies outside 
the $95\%$ confidence interval of the ones estimated with $10000$ surrogated data, then 
we consider the tail-asymmetric relationship is significant for that species-pair. 
On a community level, we calculated the fraction of significant species-pair among all correlated 
pairs considered (overall significance on the community level, $C_s$). We also perform a binomial 
test to check whether the community shows significantly stronger lower-tail (or upper-tail) association.

<!--2. For Q2:
      - brief intro about the usual way to measure community variability (variance ratio method)
      - then introduce skewness ratio in analogy with variance ratio
      - separate the contributions from tail association and usual correlation (Pearson) 
      - need schematic diagram to show the relation (this diagram will again help to interpret results for Q2 later)
      - somewhere, in results or in discussion we should talk about the aggregated effect of weak interactions
-->

To answer Q2 from \nameref{Introduction}, our approach was to assess the effect 
of tail-asymmetry between species-pairs on the stability of 
community level, which was not accounted for general variance ratio approach. Variability 
through time, be it for individual or for total community biomass, is a key component to
measure the stability [@ives1999stability]. Following we
briefly discuss about the classic variance ratio metric which is generally 
used to predict the community-stability [@schluter1984variance]. 


<!--short theoretical background to calculate phi_cv with variance ratio method, and its interpretation-->
Consider a community with $n$ number of species where individual species biomass 
or productivity ($x_i(t); i = 1, 2, \ldots, n$) being monitored 
through $t = 1, 2, \ldots, T$ years. Mean of $i^{th}$ individual species 
time series is denoted as $\mu_i = \bar{x_i}$ whereas its interaction with other species $(j)$ is
represented by the covariance $v_{ij} = \cov(x_i,x_j)$ with $v_{ij}$ being $0$ implying
independent fluctuation. On an aggregated scale, the total productivity, mean and the variance 
are represented as $x_{tot} = \sum_{i} x_i$, $\mu_{tot} = \sum_{i} \mu_i$ 
and $v_{tot} = \sum_{i,j}v_{ij}$, respectively. These quantities quantify
squared coefficient of variation ($CV_{com}^2 = v_{tot}/\mu_{tot}^2$) that measures 
the variability of the said community [@pimm1984complexity]. Usual notion to link 
stability with variability is that more variable community with 
respect to a community made of independent species 
is considered as less stable. In mathematical natation, this stability index is represented as
the classic variance ratio, $\phi_{cv}$ ($= CV_{com}^2/CV_{ind}^2 =  \sum_{i,j}v_{ij}/ \sum_{i} v_{ii}$). 
When $\phi_{cv}>1$, community is highly variable compared to a community where species are fluctuating 
independently and randomly. Synchronized fluctuation results this higher $\phi_{cv}$ and makes community 
less stable towards environmental perturbation compared to an independent community 
whereas species with compensatory dynamics (fluctuating time-series in anti-phase) makes 
a community more stable (i.e., $\phi_{cv}<1$) due to different 
functional responses from different functional group of species within the community. 

<!--alternative measure of stability: based on skewness-->
We here propose an alternative measure of 
stability for a $n$-species community. Accounting for the effect due to 
extreme environmental perturbation, it
is reasonable to consider how skewness of total 
biomass of the community changes through time compared to that of a community 
of $n$ independent species. We can consider the skewness as an indicator 
that how much the mean and the median differ for a temporal distribution 
of total community-biomass. In such case, we represent the skewness for a community as
$S_{com}=\sum_{i,j,k}m_{ijk}/\sum_{i,j,k}v_{ijk}^{3/2} = m_{tot}/v_{tot}^{3/2}$, where 
$m_{tot}$ is the 3$^{rd}$ central moment of the temporal distribution 
for total biomass of the community. If all the species within 
that community behave as independent entities, then the skewness 
for an independent community would be 
$S_{ind} = \sum_{i}m_{iii}/\sum_{i}v_{i}^{3/2}$. Therefore, we define the index for
skewness-based change in a community $\phi_{s} = S_{com}/ S_{ind}$ similar to that 
of the variance ratio metric, $\phi_{cv}$. It is trivial to show the relationship
between these two stability indices as $\phi_s = (m_{tot}/\sum_im_{iii})(1/\phi_{cv}^{3/2})$.

<!--interpretation for phi_s and stability-->
Unlike $\phi_{cv}$, $\phi_s$ can be positive, $0$ or negative depending on the 
signs of the skewnesses from the concerned community and its 
independent analog. $\phi_s >1$ indicates that
the community biomass is more positively (or more negatively) skewed
than it would have been if the species have no interactions with each other.
The opposite scenario - i.e., when the community with interacting species shows less positive
or less negative skewness than would be expected if there was no interactions - represents 
$\phi_s$ to be within the range $(0,1)$. $\phi_s \approx 0$ means skewness is eliminated by the 
interactions of the species within the community, i.e., high productivity of some species 
for some years are balanced by its proportional drop in productivity 
for other years or by other species for those same years. <!--***Shya:please review this line, am I right here? 
is this similar as of phi_cv < 1 for compensatory dynamics?--> A negative $\phi_s$ indicates 
interspefic interactions at the extreme values can alter the skewness (i.e. changing its sign) of a 
community-biomass distribution over years than it would have been expected without any interactions. 
<!--for example, see explore_phis.R where a left-tail dep. community 
with slightly right skewed marginals make phi_s -ve.-->


<!--how phi_s and phi_cv are different?-->
We recommend to use both these indices ($\phi_{cv}$ and $\phi_s$) to get 
a complete picture to predict the stability of the community. It is possible
to underestimate the stability status of the community if we only
depend on the $\phi_{cv}$, which is a correlation 
(i.e. normalized covariance) based measure. $\phi_s$, on the other hand, takes 
the extreme values or tail asymmetry between interspecific 
response into account to assess the change in community structure
over time. Therefore, two communities with similar $\phi_{cv}$ could have two drastically 
different $\phi_s$ and interpretation of stability if we consider the change of skewness as an indicator 
of community-change (examples with real data are shown in \nameref{Results}). For example, consider 
two communities $C_A$ and $C_B$ with equal number of species. It is 
possible that the species in $C_A$ show very low productivity for some 
years whereas those in $C_B$ are extremely abundant for some years, though
their overall pairwise correlation remains same. In such case, $C_A$ and $C_B$ 
should show more or less same $\phi_{cv}$ but 
different $\phi_s$, particularly $\phi_s$ for community $C_A$ 
should be less than that for community $C_B$, i.e., $0<\phi_{s,C_A}<1 < \phi_{s,C_B}$. To 
explain the theoretical basis of such difference 
between $\phi_{cv}$ and $\phi_s$, we partition the overall contribution 
in stability metric into two distict parts - due to correlation and
due to tail association for extreme values between interspecific response, as follows. 

<!--partition between correlation and tail association effect in phi_s, phi_cv-->
As we have mentioned earlier, the skewness of a community ($S_{com}$) is related 
with its independent analog ($S_{ind}$) by the scaling factor $\phi_s$ that can be considered 
as a measure of community-change over time. This $\phi_s$ can have two distinct 
contributions: $\phi_{s,cor}$ (due to only correlation) 
and $\phi_{s,ta}$ (due to tail-asymmetry), i.e., $\phi_s = \phi_{s,cor} \times \phi_{s,ta}$. 
One can consider $\phi_{s,cor}$ as a factor by which skewness of an independent-community 
($S_{ind}$, skewness for species without any interactions) changes to the skewness of 
the community when species show correlated fluctuations but no asymmetric tail-association ($S_{nta}$), 
i.e., $S_{ind} = \phi_{s,cor} \times S_{nta}$. From now on, we will mention the later type of community 
as 'tail-symmetric' community where interspecific response showed no 
stronger correlation in either tail. Theoretically, one can make this tail-symmetric community 
from the given community matrix by removing the asymmetric tail-association 
among species but keeping the pairwise Pearson correlation same (upto sampling variation) via 
algorithm stated in Appendix \ref{SI-alg_pp_com}. Now, if the interspecific response 
are more correlated in their lower or higher values (i.e., asymmetric 
tail-association) over years, then the skewness for the tail-symmetric community 
would change by a factor $\phi_{s,ta}$ such that $S_{com} = \phi_{s,ta} \times S_{nta}$.
We can also consider the corresponding analog for variance ratio metric, i.e., 
$\phi_{cv} = \phi_{cv,cor} \times \phi_{cv,ta}$ but as co-variance does not incorporate the effect
for extreme values, $\phi_{cv,ta}$ would be $\approx 1$. The relations between independent, tail-symmetric 
and the given community with all these metrics are shown as a schematic diagram in Fig. \ref{fig_schematic_box}. 
<!--What to expect for the values of $\phi_s$'s with two different kinds of tail-asymmetry?-->
For a given community where most of the species showed stronger correlation in 
lower values (i.e. stronger lower tail association with $A_{tot}>0$), one can 
expect the change in skewness would be in the order $S_{com} < S_{nta} < S_{ind}$ where 
$\phi_s$ and $\phi_{s,ta}$ would be of similar values and $\phi_{s,ta} < \phi_{s,cor}$ as 
lower tail association tends to suppress the skewness (Fig. \ref{fig_pedag_taildep}E-F). If the 
community showed stronger tail-association for the higher values of 
species-time series (i.e. $A_{tot}<0$), skewness should change in 
reverse order, i.e., $S_{com} > S_{nta} > S_{ind}$.
This anticipitation is consistent with the fact that upper tail 
association tends to increase the skewness (Fig. \ref{fig_pedag_taildep}G-H). The stronger the 
tail-asymmetry for the interspecific response within the community (i.e. higher $|A_{tot}|$), the larger would be 
the difference between $\phi_{s,cor}$ and $\phi_{s,ta}$. The complete reproducible workflow 
for this project is available at https://github.com/sghosh89/Copula_spaceavg. Following we will present
the results from the analyses with two examplary long-term community data.

We here present the results from the study carried out with two long-term
spatio-temporal data sets: basal cover data (for 51 quadrats over 41 years, 1932-1972)
of mixed grass priarie near Hays, KS and (for details see
Appendix \ref{SI-Data}). We here analyzed
our findings from a model-selection based 
copula approach, but we also verified the overall finding using
alternative nonparametric analysis (Appendix \ref{SI-compare_methods}).

<!--Results from Hays-->
We carried out the tail-dependence analysis with the basal cover time series of
20 most common species and the rest of the species data aggregated into single pseudo-species
found in prairie of Hays, Kansas (Table \ref{SI-tab_spinfo_hays}). We
found lower tail-dependence (considering positively correlation in
counting lower and upper tail dependent pairwise copula) were dominant, overall, in 
the community (Fig. \ref{fig_LTmUT_spaceavg_hays}). We will discuss here few instances 
of interspecific interactions which 
we found interesting. Some deep rooted grasses (e.g. sp2 : ANGE, 
sp11 : PAVI2 and sp13 : PSTE5) showed upper tail dependence with synchronous abundance
with each other (Fig. \ref{fig_LTmUT_spaceavg_hays}) 
whereas they were not as strongly 
correlated in other years 
(see Fig. \ref{SI-fig_hays_spaceavg_dryseasoned_grass_UTdep}). 
On the other hand, when \textit{Schizachyrium scoparium} (sp14) was abundant throughout 
the plots for certain years, it appeared to be a stronger competitor 
(Fig \ref{SI-fig_hays_spaceavg_SCSC_interactions}) suppressing growth of 
other drought-tolerant grasses (e. g. \textit{Bouteloua gracilis} (sp5), 
\textit{Paronychia jamesii} (sp12), 
\textit{Sporobolus asper} (sp17) , \textit{Sporobolus cryptandrus} (sp18)) which
were found to be synchronously rare and lower tail-dependent within themselves (positively 
correlated red cells in Fig. \ref{fig_LTmUT_spaceavg_hays}).

<!--Results from skewness as a measure of community variability-->

<!--Need to modify the following results-->

<!--Major lower tail dependence than upper, as observed in interspecific interactions 
in both grassland communities (Figs. \ref{fig_LTmUT_spaceavg_jrg}-\ref{fig_LTmUT_spaceavg_hays},
$nL>NU$) could play a significant contributors in predicting their stabilities. Via skewness 
measurement of total productivity through out the study period, one can assess an alternate measure 
of community-variability. Following the idea as we introduced in the earlier section, 
for each of the 36 years (1983-2018), we computed total percent cover
(averaged throughout the plots) of the species in Jasper Ridge.
We measured skewness of this aggregated percent cover time-series and compared against 
skewnesses of $10000$ "Normal" surrogate time-series which were meant to have no tail-dependence
but same pairwise Spearman correlation between species (for details see Appendix \ref{SI-skew_ncsurrog}).
We repeated this procedure for five different combination of species (see Fig. \ref{SI-fig_jrg_spaceavg_skewness})
in JRBP: considering total percent cover timeseries from (i) only 23 common sp., (ii) 23 common sp. and 
rest aggregated into one pseudo sp., 
(iii) 34 common and intermediate sp., (iv) 34 common and intermediate sp. along with the rest aggregated into 
one pseudo sp., (v) all sp. including the rare ones (for classification of species 
categories see Appendix \ref{SI-Data}, Fig. \ref{SI-fig_spaceavg_timeseries}). As a community with major lower tail dependence, JRBP was 
expected to show significantly lower skewness than symmetric "Normal" surrogates. We found the expected results with 
all five combinations. Similar results with significant lower skewness
because of dominant lower tail-dependence in the comminity was observed with Hays datasets (Fig. 
\ref{SI-fig_hays_spaceavg_skewness}). As skewness is related to the "spikiness" of the time-series
concerned, significantly lower skewness than its "Normal" analog scale means the community could have 
a potential threat for some of its native species which could crash simultaneously below a threshold. -->

\caption{Upper panel shows a schematic diagram of the known $(A)$ variance-ratio approach usually used
to assess community-stability and our proposed $(B)$ skewness-based analog; \textit{CV} and \textit{S} denote 
coefficient of variation and skewness, respectively. White boxes indicate a missing link between 
the two extremes: an actual community ($com$) having both correlation and tail 
association between species and its independent ($ind$) analog with no
interspecific interaction. This is explored in detail later (Fig. \ref{fig_method_box}).
Lower panel shows pedagogical
figures of asymmetric tail associations between $200$ observations of 
two positively correlated (same Spearman correlation $\rho = 0.8$) random variables $(x,y)$ with 
$(C)$ stronger lower-tail and $(D)$ stronger 
upper-tail association.\label{fig_pedag_taildep}}

\caption{Measure of tail-asymmetry for most common plant species along with 
other species merged into a pseudo species (Tables \ref{SI-tab_spinfo_hays}, \ref{SI-tab_spinfo_knz}) 
found in (A) Hays and (B) Konza priarie, 
details were discussed in \nameref{Results}. 
$n_L$ and $n_U$ are the count of cells (considered for positive correlation only)
with positive and negative tail-asymmetry  
values; 
$n_L>n_U$ (majority of red cells) indicates major lower tail association
in sp-sp interaction matrix.
Yellow cells indicate independent relationship. For initially negatively correlated 
cells (indicated by green dots), we measured the tail asymmetry by taking negative of the 
timeseries of species shown in column, so the sign (or color) of the cells do not matter but 
the absolute values. Cross sign in the cells indicate the interspecific tail-asymmetry is not 
significant (95\% CI) when considered individually, but on an aggregate level 
pose significant contribution. (for details see text).\label{fig_CorlmCoru_spaceavg_hays}}

\caption{Pedagogical figure showing how skewness of total biomass distribution of a community 
is affected by extreme asymmetric tail-association (Appendix \ref{SI-extreme_taildep_mat}) in individual 
species biomass-distribution throughout years. Major lower tail association in 
a community makes its total biomass more negatively skewed $(B)$, whereas
major upper tail association in a community makes 
its total biomass more positively skewed $(D)$, compared to a
community which is generated via a resampling method (Appendix \ref{SI-skew_ncsurrog})
to have no tail-dependence but preserving pairwise Spearman correlation
between any two species' time series.\label{fig_result_box}}
