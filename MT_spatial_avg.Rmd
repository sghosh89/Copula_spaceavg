<!--Q1 : is there asymmetric tail dependence in a grassland community? what is the interpretation for any individual sp. pair?, 
Q2: How it could affect the productivity? (connection to skewness)
Skewness change due to asymmetric taildep. as a new estimate of community variability?-->

<!--grassland and earlier work : Here I deliberately exclude the ref. for environmental variable effect on species-->
\lettrine{U}{}nderstanding the mechanisms behind spatial and temporal 
dynamics has been a long-standing focus in community ecology [@gibson2009; @turner1989].
Interspecies interaction in a grassland 
community could be advantageous or
disadvantageous to either or both species involved, 
which led to mutualism or competition
as the case might be. A community is thought to be resilient towards environmental extremes
through time when members of that community show variable and/ or asynchronous fluctuations. But if most of 
the species in a community vary synchronously through time then in a "bad"
year (e.g. extreme drought) with limiting resource could wipe out the whole community.
Thus identifying patterns of species fluctuations over time and in relation to 
each other is essential to understand community-stability. Most of the prior studies 
used, in general, the correlation or regression based approach to 
understand variability of a species response with other
species within a community (or with environmental variables) to establish causal
relationship. But they are inadequate to explain the joint distribution structure 
of multiple species response within a community.

<!--Limitation of usual approach and introduction of copula?-->
Common correlation measures, i. e., Pearson's correlation used in earlier studies, is based 
on the notions of linearity, normality and mean which are not appropriate when dealing 
with extreme events or for non-normal distributions which occur commonly in ecological
datasets [our BIVAN paper]. Though rank-based non-parametric dependence measures, Spearman's 
$\rho$ and Kendall's $\tau$, do not assume linearity and normality, but they do not attribute 
sufficient weight to the extreme values and the distribution tail. Thus a better approach to model
multivariate dependence structure is necessary. Concept of a copula is a widely used 
statistical tool in other fields to model dependence between 
multiple variables [@joe2014_dependence; @nelsen2006_copula; 
@sklar1959_theorem; @burnham2003_modelselection]. A "copula" can separate the 
information contained in a joint distribution of bivariate random variables 
into two distinct parts: the information contained in the marginal 
distributions (which says nothing about the dependence between the 
variables), and the remaining information (which is solely
about the dependence between the variables). From a data perspective, we can construct 
a bivariate copula from a set of two variables
$\{ x_i, y_i\}, i = 1, 2, \ldots , n$ after some ranking procedure is applied so that 
their marginal distributions become uniform. If $\{ \bar{u_i}, \bar{v_i}\}$ are the
corresponding ranks of $\{ x_i, y_i\}$, then the "normalized rank" 
$\{ u_i, v_i\} = \{ \bar{u_i}, \bar{v_i}\} / (n+1)$
reveals the associated dependence in the bivariate copula when plotted in a unit square. 
Through suitable choice from a wide varity of families and parameters, one can control 
this dependence structure of a bivariate copula which shows over which parts of the 
distributions the variables are more strongly associated. This information
is implied in their degree of "tail-dependence" which can be viewed as stronger 
association between two random variables in their extreme values. If smaller values of 
two positively associated variables are more strongly correlated than are larger values, 
the variables are said to have stronger lower- or left-tail dependence than right- or 
upper-tail dependence (Fig. \ref{fig_pedag_taildep}A); and vice versa if higher values are more strongly
associated than smaller ones (Fig. \ref{fig_pedag_taildep}B). A copula might have symmetric 
(with zero tail-dependence in both tail) or asymmetric (finite tail-dependence in either
or both tail) feature depending on its family and parameters [@nelsen2006_copula].

<!--why copula (and tail-dep.) is important in ecology, specially on grassland? : 
1) direction of competetion
2) leibig's law
3) global climate change : ongoing invasion and sp. extinction : pollinators?
-->
The relevance of a copula with its unique tail-dependence feature is that it can be applied
to model synchronous (or compensatory) response between two or more ecological variables. 
Spatial synchrony [@liebhold2004; @walter2017; @sheppard2016] between 
metapopulations, is recently investigated using copula (BIVAN paper),
but there has been no report using copula approach in explaining 
multi-species dynamics within a commulity.
Here we will summarize how copula could be useful in ecology, specially in a grassland 
ecosystem perspective. First, in case of compensatory dynamics between any two species 
over years, tail dependence
measurement using a bivariate copula not only shows species are negatively correlated but 
in addition could indicate which one is superior competitor between them. Secondly, earlier 
studies showed the importance of limiting resources (soil nutrients, N, P)
(Leibig's law) in the grassland productivity [@reynolds2003; @de2004; @john2007; @fay2015]. 
Therefore, a community showing overall
lower tail-dependence throughout years could suggest that the species-abundance on average
was limited as a particular resource became rare in that field and experimental addition of 
soil-fertilizer could improve their productivity after years. As multiple species in a
grassland community could show limited growth
with respect to multiple nutrients and to different extent, therefore adding nutrient 
may increase the net primary productivity but could also reduce niche-dimensionality 
and increase compositional turnover [@harpole2016]. Using pairwise copula approach for
modelling a multivariate dependence structure offers more insight to understand
individual species' response towards their drivers separately. Third, long-term and short-term
experiments established that change in global climate induced changes in species-composition 
in a grassland community 
[@cowles2016; @garcia2018; @harrison2015; @eisenhauer2013; @zavaleta2003]. 
For example, abundant growth of invasive species in their "favorable" scope on
space or time-scale [@white2001; @thomason2017] could suppress
and even lead to extinction of their weak competitors which are natives in a community.
This scenario could also evoke a potential threat for the pollinator 
community (e.g. butterfly) due to their habitat loss [@mclaughlin2002; @thomas2004].
Monitoring tail-dependence of species-above ground biomass of 
a plant with respect to any of biotic and/ or abiotic factors could be beneficial
against this threat of biodiversity loss in a grassland eco-system. 

<!--community variability in view of skewness change?-->
Overall asymmetric tail-dependence (either lower or upper) bears a major implication
in estimating the pattern of community-variability and thus in turn stability of its 
compositional balance. A major lower (or upper) tail dependence in community structure arises 
due to simultaneous rare (or abundant) occurrence of the species and thus the "spikiness" of 
their individual time series become more or less synchronous in their low (or high) values.
Lower tail dependence in the time series of individual species biomass makes total biomass 
distribution of a community through years less skewed (see Fig. \ref{fig_pedag_skewness}A, synchronous 
fluctuations in low values) whereas upper tail dependence leads to more skewed 
(see Fig. \ref{fig_pedag_skewness}B, synchronous 
fluctuations in high values) distribution of total productivity through years
as compared to a community having no major asymmetric tail-dependence feature. 
Significantly lower skewness (arising from lower 
tail dependence) not only affects net primary productivity of a community 
but could also make some native species disappear from the system. The second scenario is 
that the overall skewness could change abruptly due to some "episodic" species, which occur 
in plenty in the community all of a sudden. Thus in a favorable scope of year, these episodic species
could take over the existing community and change the compositional balance in subsequent stages. 
Tracking skewness of a community over a period of years could serve
beneficial to better strategize conservation and management of native species. 
In terms of stability assessment, a community could be considered as less stable 
if the absolute value of skewness of total biomass time series is relatively high 
which, we argue, is coming from the stronger correlation of individual species-biomass
in their extreme values. <!-- am I right for this last sentence?-->

<!--Why choose jasper ridge and hays as study system?-->
In this paper, we will preach for the potential of using "copula" approach to analyze
species' response within a community in understanding variation in species-richness
over a temporal scale. We consider two grassland ecosystems for our study. First one 
is Jasper Ridge Biological
Preserve (JRBP), a biodiversity hotspot in californian serpentine grassland. 
Long term observations in JRBP showed the serpentine grassland vary widely in its 
species composition both in temporal and spatial scale [@hobbs2007; @zhu2016]. 
Climate change and invasion by 
exotic species in JRBP had detrimental effect on native species 
shifting its dominance 
from one species to another
and thereby posing habitat loss of their
dependent species leading to extinction [@stromberg2007]. 
For example, bay-checkerspot butterfly 
\textit{Euphydryas editha bayensis} is now locally extinct at Jasper Ridge 
possibly due to declining abundance of its principal larval 
host plant \textit{Plantago erecta}
in competition with invasive species like \textit{Bromus hordeaceus}.
The second dataset we choose to invetigate is long-term mapping of 
individual herbaceous plants on permanent quadrats in a mixed grass 
priarie of Hays, Kansas. Hays grassland also played major role in investigating 
plants' demographic process, their co-existence and extreme climatic effect 
on annual productivity 
in the past studies [@fair1999demography; @adler2006climate; 
@lauenroth2008demography; @heisler2009contingent].
Both datasets (Appendix \ref{SI-Data}) have been served as experimental model system to 
study ecological hypothesis since long and proved to be effective
in decision making from conservation and management perspective. 

<!-- what is our objective?-->
 Our objective is to examine the 
synchronous (for positively correlated variables)
or compensatory (for negatively correlated variables) dynamics, if any, in 
the serpentine grassland of JRBP and prairie of Hays in Kansas 
using "tail-dependence" feature of copula.
Implementing a model selection approach (Appendix \ref{SI-model_sel}) as well as nonparametric 
analysis (Appendix \ref{SI-nonparam}), we 
try to find is there any overall major asymmetric tail-dependence in those grassland community and
if there is, then what could we interpret about inter-species response from this
asymmetric tail-dependence? We also suggest an alternative measure of 
community variability (henceforth stability) in terms of quantifying skewness of 
total biomass distribution over years using those two datasets.

# Results\label{Results}

As mentioned earlier, we here present the results from the study carried out with the
spatio-temporal percent cover data (for 216 plots over 36 years, 1983-2018)
of Jasper Ridge Biological Preserve (JRBP) and 41 years (1932-1972) long basal cover
data from 51 quadrats of mixed grass priarie near Hays, KS (for details see
Appendix \ref{SI-Data}). We here analyzed
our findings from a model-selection based 
copula approach, but we also verified the overall finding using
alternative nonparametric analysis (Appendix \ref{SI-compare_methods}).

<!--## Results from jrg spaceavg LT-UT matrix plot-->
Tail-dependence analysis 
(see Appendix \ref{SI-Methods} for details)
was carried out with pairwise copula
made of spatially averaged percent cover time-series (1983-2018)
of 23 most common species found in JRBP (Table \ref{SI-tab_spinfo_jrg}).
The multi-species interaction matrix in Fig. \ref{fig_LTmUT_spaceavg_jrg}
showed tail-dependence difference (lower minus upper) plotted 
for each pair-wise copula. 
Spatially averaged data could only show a prominent
tail-dependence results in
our case when there is stronger correlation for some unusually 
good or bad years for both species' percent-cover considered.

We found considerable amount of interspecific competetion
and co-existence with overall major lower tail-dependence in 
the serpentine grassland community of JRBP.
Here we will 
discuss a few exemplary cases. For instance,
when invasive species \textit{Bromus hordeaceus} were more abundant
throughout the plots over certain years,
native species \textit{Plantago Erecta} could not do well 
and became rare from the
system for those years, but when \textit{Bromus} was scarce in the
system \textit{Plantago} showed a varied abundance. 
This phenomenon indicated the causal relationship that
\textit{Bromus} appeared to be a stronger competitor
limiting \textit{Plantago}'s growth synchronously [represented in 
Fig. \ref{fig_LTmUT_spaceavg_jrg}
by the blue cell indicating 
stronger upper tail-dependence between yearly percent cover of
\textit{Bromus} (sp6 in row) and 
\textit{Plantago} (sp31 in column, plotted as negative
percent cover, so that the copula showed positive correlation,
see Fig. \ref{SI-fig_jrg_spaceavg_invasion} for details].
The interaction was conceptually same
as shown by the red cell with lower tail-dependence in 
Fig \ref{fig_LTmUT_spaceavg_jrg}(sp31 in row and
sp6 in column). Strong co-existence with similar dynamics was 
found (both abundant simultaneosly 
in certain years) between two native annuals \textit{Hemizonia congesta}
and \textit{Lotus wrangelianus} (Fig. \ref{fig_LTmUT_spaceavg_jrg}, blue cell
with upper tail dependence between sp17, sp24). When \textit{Hemizonia} and 
\textit{Lotus} were not dominantly prolific in the system, they did not 
show a strong correlation 
and another weak competitor \textit{Microseris douglasii} got a chance to flourish.
When those two species (\textit{Hemizonia} and \textit{Lotus}) were both 
abundant in their "good" years (specifically 3 successive years from 2016-2018,
native annual \textit{Microseris} (sp28) became uncommon and appeared as a weak 
competitor towards their joint
competitive pressure (sp17 and sp24 in rows with sp28 in column, for details
see Fig. \ref{SI-fig_jrg_spaceavg_competition}). If this trend continues, then it could be 
a potential threat for existence of native species \textit{Microseris douglasii}. 
This type of "diffuse competition" intrigued many experimental studies in the past 
to better understand plant competition and facilitation in serpentine grassland 
[@harrison2011] and in our study we showed tail-dependence could be a measure
to understand inter-specific competition and mutualism in a multi-species metric. 

On a similar note, we carried out the tail-dependence analysis with the basal cover time series of
20 most common species found in prairie of Hays, Kansas (Table \ref{SI-tab_spinfo_hays}). We
found similar trend as of 
JRBP, showing lower tail-dependence (considering positively correlation in
counting lower and upper tail dependent pairwise copula) were dominant, overall, in 
the community (Fig. \ref{fig_LTmUT_spaceavg_hays}). We will discuss here few instances 
of interspecific interactions which 
we found interesting. Some deep rooted grasses (e.g. sp2 : ANGE, 
sp11 : PAVI2 and sp13 : PSTE5) showed upper tail dependence with synchronous abundance
with each other (Fig. \ref{fig_LTmUT_spaceavg_hays}) 
whereas they were not as strongly 
correlated in other years 
(see Fig. \ref{SI-fig_hays_spaceavg_dryseasoned_grass_UTdep}). 
On the other hand, when \textit{Schizachyrium scoparium} (sp14) was abundant throughout 
the plots for certain years, it appeared to be a stronger competitor 
(Fig \ref{SI-fig_hays_spaceavg_SCSC_interactions}) suppressing growth of 
other drought-tolerant grasses (e. g. \textit{Bouteloua gracilis} (sp5), 
\textit{Paronychia jamesii} (sp12), 
\textit{Sporobolus asper} (sp17) , \textit{Sporobolus cryptandrus} (sp18)) which
were found to be synchronously rare and lower tail-dependent within themselves (positively 
correlated red cells in Fig. \ref{fig_LTmUT_spaceavg_hays}).

<!--Results from skewness as a measure of community variability-->
Major lower tail dependence than upper, as observed in interspecific interactions 
in both grassland communities (Figs. \ref{fig_LTmUT_spaceavg_jrg}-\ref{fig_LTmUT_spaceavg_hays},
$nL>NU$) could play a significant contributors in predicting their stabilities. Via skewness 
measurement of total productivity through out the study period, one can assess an alternate measure 
of community-variability. Following the idea as we introduced in the earlier section, 
for each of the 36 years (1983-2018), we computed total percent cover
(averaged throughout the plots) of the species in Jasper Ridge.
We measured skewness of this aggregated percent cover time-series and compared against 
skewnesses of $10000$ "Normal" surrogate time-series which were meant to have no tail-dependence
but same pairwise Spearman correlation between species (for details see Appendix \ref{SI-skew_ncsurrog}).
We repeated this procedure for five different combination of species (see Fig. \ref{SI-fig_jrg_spaceavg_skewness})
in JRBP: considering total percent cover timeseries from (i) only 23 common sp., (ii) 23 common sp. and 
rest aggregated into one pseudo sp., 
(iii) 34 common and intermediate sp., (iv) 34 common and intermediate sp. along with the rest aggregated into 
one pseudo sp., (v) all sp. including the rare ones (for classification of species 
categories see Appendix \ref{SI-Data}, Fig. \ref{SI-fig_spaceavg_timeseries}). As a community with major lower tail dependence, JRBP was 
expected to show significantly lower skewness than symmetric "Normal" surrogates. We found the expected results with 
all five combinations. Similar results with significant lower skewness
because of dominant lower tail-dependence in the comminity was observed with Hays datasets (Fig. 
\ref{SI-fig_hays_spaceavg_skewness}). As skewness is related to the "spikiness" of the time-series
concerned, significantly lower skewness than its "Normal" analog scale means the community could have 
a potential threat for some of its native species which could crash simultaneously below a threshold.
