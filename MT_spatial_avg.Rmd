# Introduction\label{Introduction}

Understanding the extent to which, and the mechanisms by which, species interactions in an ecological 
community help stabilize or destabilize the ecosystem as a whole is a topic that has fascinated ecologists 
for decades [@macarthur1955fluctuations; @paine1969note; @grimm1992application; @pimm1984complexity; @gonzalez2009causes]. 
An important early insight was that an aggregate 
community property such as the total biomass of all species can be relatively stable through time, even 
while the dynamics of individual species are highly variable, if different species exhibit offsetting fluctuations.
This is often refered to as *compensatory dynamics*, because decreases in species abundances are compensated
for by simultaneous increases in other species [@frost1995species;@bai2004ecosystem;@hallett2014]. When species instead exhibit 
positively correlated fluctuations through time, it tends to cause increased variability through time in the community 
aggregate property [@keitt2008coherent;@loreau2008species;@ma2017climate]. This is called *synchrony* because 
species dynamics are partly synchronized in their fluctuations. Thus an important part of what determines 
the variability of an aggregate community property is the nature
of relationships between the dynamics of different species. 

Historically, how species relationships influence community stability, including questions of compensatory 
and synchronous dynamics, have been investigated principally by examining the coefficient of variation through time
of the aggregate community property, together with covariances between species population abundance time series.
For instance, if $x_i(t)$ are data representing the population abundances of species $i=1,\ldots,N$ at the sampling times
$t=1,\ldots,T$, and if $\mu_i=\mean(x_i)$, $v_{ii}=\var(x_i)$, and $v_{ij}=\cov(x_i,x_j)$, community variability
has commonly been quantified using the squared coefficient of variation of $\xtot(t)=\sum_i x_i(t)$, i.e., 
$\CVcomsq=\var(\xtot)/\left(\mean(\xtot)\right)^2=\left(\sum_{i,j} v_{ij}\right)/\left(\sum \mu_i\right)^2$.
And this formula obviously connects to species relationships via the covariances, $v_{ij}$, which appear directly in the formula. Denoting by 
$\CVindsq=\left(\sum_i v_{ii}\right)/\left(\sum \mu_i\right)^2$ the value that $\CVcomsq$ would take if 
the dynamics of each species were independent of the dynamics of all other species (so $v_{ij}=0$ for all $i \neq j$), the 
classic *variance ratio* was defined [@schluter1984variance;@peterson1975] as 
$\phi_{\text{cv}}=\CVcomsq/\CVindsq=\var(\xtot)/\left(\sum_i v_{ii}\right)=\left(\sum_{i,j} v_{ij}\right)/\left(\sum_i v_{ii}\right)$. 
The variance ratio has very commonly been used [@houlahan2007;@winfree2009;@hallett2014] as an index of whether dynamics 
are synchronous or compensatory. If $\phi_{\text{cv}}>1$, the interpretation has been that dynamics are, on balance,
synchronous because then $\CVcomsq>\CVindsq$, i.e., the total community biomass $\xtot$ is more variable than
it would be if species dynamics were independent. Conversely, if $\phi_{\text{cv}}<1$, the interpretation has been
that dynamics are, on balance, compensatory. 

Timescale-specific extensions of the variance ratio [@vasseur2007;
@brown2016;@zhao2020] have revealed that it is possible for compensatory 
dynamics to occur on some timescales while 
synchronous dynamics simultaneously occur on other timescales, and other improvements and alternatives to the variance ratio 
have also been proposed [@loreau2008species]. However, $\phi_{\text{cv}}$ is still very commonly used, 
and the nature of how species relationships influence community stability is likely to be substantially 
more nuanced and interesting than is revealed by either the classic variance ratio approach or
by any existing extensions of which we are aware. To 
begin to illustrate the concepts we will explore in this 
study, and to understand what has been omitted from earlier approaches, we consider two artifically
generated community dynamics datasets (Fig. \ref{fig_pedag_cv2_skw}A, B; data generated as in SI section X).
<!--***DAN: Dan to fill in the X in the above line, and write the corresponding section of the SI.-->
Both model communities consist of $N=10$ species, and data were generated so that species marginal distributions 
(and therefore the means, $\mu_i$, and variances, $v_{ii}$, 
through time) were the same, up to sampling variance, in both cases. Likewise, data were 
generated so that pairwise species covariances, $v_{ij}$ for $i \neq j$,
were essentially the same for Fig. \ref{fig_pedag_cv2_skw}A and B. Thus both $\CVcomsq$ and $\CVindsq$, which 
depend only on the $\mu_i$ and $v_{ij}$,
were the same in both cases, and so $\phi_{\text{cv}}$ was also the same. The Loreau-de Mazancourt variance ratio
[@loreau2008species], which itself depends only on the $v_{ij}$, was also the same, up to sampling variance, in the two cases 
(Fig. \ref{fig_pedag_cv2_skw}A, B). Classical approaches such as these do not distinguish between our two cases, neither in the nature
of species interrelationships nor in the effects of interrelationships on community aggregate dynamics $\xtot(t)$.

Nevertheless, species relationships and resulting aggregate dynamics differed in important ways in these cases. In both cases,
the ten species could be separated into two groups of five species (red and black lines on Fig. \ref{fig_pedag_cv2_skw}A, B), 
and the dynamics of species in different groups were strongly compensatory. However, in case 1 (Fig. \ref{fig_pedag_cv2_skw}A), 
species in the same group exhibited strongly synchronous dynamics when rare and much less synchronous dynamics when 
common; whereas in case 2 (Fig. \ref{fig_pedag_cv2_skw}B) species in the same group exhibited strongly synchronous dynamics 
when common and much less synchronous dynamics when rare. Dynamics of this kind could occur ecologically, for instance, in case 1,
(Fig. \ref{fig_pedag_cv2_skw}A) if red species were sensitive to an environmental factor such as precipitation, but only when it 
takes values below a threshold. So all the red species are controlled by the same factor, precipitation, when it is below the threshold,
and hence are synchronous when rare. 
When precipitation is above the threshold, the red species are each sensitive, instead, to other, distinct factors, rendering them asynchronous
when common. Black species 
of (Fig. \ref{fig_pedag_cv2_skw}A) may also be senstive to precipitation, but in a reverse manner, being all simultaneously 
harmed by precipitation when it is
above the threshold and unaffected by precipitation below the threshold. Resulting community dynamics 
(Fig. \ref{fig_pedag_cv2_skw}C-F) were quite different in our two cases because of the distinct species interrelationships.
Total community biomass was left-skewed, frequently crashing to low values, for case 1; but was right skewed, frequently
exploding to high values, in case 2. It is not difficult to imagine cascading ecological ramifications or 
potential applied significance of the distinction our example illustrates. For instance, grazers subsisting on a grass mixture that 
exhibits frequent crashes may experience different population growth prospects than grazers consuming a grass mixture that
shows frequent explosions of abundance. 
Thus species interrelationships and their effects on community aggregate dynamics can differ in potentially ecologically
meaningful ways which are nevertheless not detected by classic approaches. 
It is the reliance of earlier approaches on the coefficient of variation, covariance and related linear tools
for quantifying species relationships that causes those approaches to be unable to register the differences
we have illustrated here.
<!--***DAN: Shyamolina, can you please make the following changes to the figure?
1) Please delete the text that appears on the panels themselves in A and B (but keep the panel
labels that say "(A)" and "(B)"). Adjust the y axis extents of both panels so the time series ocupy the 
space vacated by the deleted text, so the reader can see these time series better. Please keep the y-axis 
extents the same on both panels.
***Shya: Done.
2) Across the bottom of A (likewise, B), please display CV_com^2, CV_ind^2, \phi_cv, and \phi_LdM, their 
values as well as the notation which tells the reader what each value is. \phi_LdM is the Loreau and 
de Mazancourt variance ratio, which is defined in eq 41 of the sup mat of Lei's paper "A new variance 
ratio metric...". Please add a computation of \phi_{LdM} to your Rmd code so you can include the value 
here. The value should be about the same for A and B.
***Shya: Done, I did not edit the fig caption...once we settle down to a good fig with notational edits, we will add that.
3) Please replace \mu on C and D by the approriate rendering of $\mean(x_{\text{tot}})$, and likewise replace
v by the appropriate rendering of $\var(x_{\text{tot}})$. Please also insert $\text{skew}(x_{\text{tot}})$
and the value of that skewness. Please make the formats for all three of these be parallel (currently the skew
is black and to the left, and the mean and variance are blue and to the right), and please also use parallel
formatting choices to what you use in panels A and B to put values on the panels.
***Shya: Done. Though I don't know where were my mean and var wrong? Now it changes as my time series also changes - previously I gave a shift of +1 to the individual time series just to ensure nothing goes negative biomass, that's why mean was ~54.5..Now, I deleted that shift and checked my individual timeseries is positive. 
Now, the mean and var are okay?
4) Please delete the text that appears on panels E and F, but keep the panel labels.
***Shya: Done.
5) change the y-axis in A, B to be a latex rendering of "Individual species biomass, x_i(t)" 
***Shya: Done.
6) change the y-axis in C, D to be a latex rendering of "Total community biomass, x_{\text{tot}}(t)". Likewise 
for the x axis of E, F 
***Shya: Done.
7) make the y axis of E, F read "Count" 
***Shya: Done.
8) make the thresholds used in C-F be 50-51 and 59-60 (see below on how to chose specific values). On panels E and F, insert two labels on each panel in the format "P=x" which give the probability of being above the higher threshold or below the lower threshold. Please these probabilities near on the panel to the tails of the distributions that they give information about. Select your thresholds in such a way that there is a clear difference between the lower-tail probabilities on the two panels, and also between the upper-tail probabilities on the two panels. Of course the horizontal lines on C, D should also be modified to correspond to the new thresholds. Make sure you choose thresholds so the time series on C goes below the lower threshold at least once, and the time series on F goes above the upper threshold at least once.

This study is centered around three suggestions about how research on the effects of species 
relationships on variability of a community aggregate property may devlop into the future;
and we take some first steps toward implementing these suggestions. First, statistical descriptions of community 
stability/variability that are more nuanced than the coefficient of variation ought to be developed 
and used. The results of Fig. \ref{fig_pedag_cv2_skw} suggest that measures related to skewness may
be useful first steps. The second suggestion is that descriptions ought to be applied, of how species time series 
relate to each other in a community, that are more nuanced than the covariance and correlation approaches
that have overwhelmingly been used so far. Fig. \ref{fig_pedag_cv2_skw} suggests that measures might be
useful that isolate the extent to which species abundances are more related to each other when the species
are common, or rare. The third suggestion is that we ought to then study how species relationships
influence community community stability/variability using the more nuanced statistical descriptors. 

The core ideas of this study relate to rare events, and specifically how the relationships between the constituents of 
an aggregate quantity change during rare events. There are strong conceptual and methodological connections to
risk pricing in finance. A portfolio of investments is supposed to reduce risk if the constituent investments 
are uncorrelated. But correlation among constituents can accentuate instead of reducing risk. Some observers have 
blamed the 2008 financial crisis on a trend under which many analysts estimated correlations between housing default
risks based on data from normal times, not taking into account that in a crisis, default risks become much more correlated. 
A single financial approach [@li2000] was apparently widely used [@salmon2009]. The relationship between two 
quantities, be they investment risks or species populations, can probably never be completely captured by a single number
such as a covariance [@cheung2013], or considered to be constant through time. Just as mortgage defaults which were typically uncorrelated 
became correlated when the macroeconomic situation worsened, it seems likely that abundances of two species in a community may
be more or less correlated with each other under different circumstances, and classical approaches that characterize relationships
between species using covariances may be neglecting something important. 

<!--***DAN: Now do some ECE connection-->

 



<!--***DAN: Not sure how relevant this stuff is, but keeping it around for now, partly for the references.
There are reasons to focus on skewness to better understand the community-stability 
in this rapidly changing world. Earlier studies [@smith2011ecological; @hoover2014resistance; 
@felton2017integrating] showed climatic events that are extreme and 
sometimes spatially well-spread impact the net productivity of community [@ciais2005europe],
community assembly [@thibault2008impact] and even induce a shift in 
ecotone boundaries [@allen1998drought]. Not only the mean and variance, the symmetry of 
temporal distribution for such climatic signals is also changing [@ummenhofer2017extreme]. This 
change in symmetry results into change in the skewness that can act on the community as well 
as on ecosystem level. Another reason is like variance changing skewness had been 
used earlier as an indicator for changing ecosystem (i.e. for an early 
warning signal, regime shift, etc.) [@guttal2008changing; @guttal2009spatial; 
@dakos2010spatial; @dakos2012methods]. But to our knowledge, there is a gap to incorporate 
this skewness into direct community-stability metric.-->

<!--p4: Following the arguments, we need an additional measure which 
could incorporate the "skewness changing" feature of the community. Fig 2(A-B): Box simple diagram.
Skewness has been found as an indicator even in the studies for 
early warning signal or regime shifts (citations)-->
Following the above argument, we need an additional measure that could 
include the changing skewness feature of the community. 
Keeping this in mind, we propose an analogous skewness-based approach 
to that of variance-based one in Fig. \ref{fig_pedag_taildep}. The skewness ratio,
$\phi_{s}$, could tell us how interspecific interaction (even the 
nonlinear response) changes the net productivity over the years 
compared to an independent community. But still, we don't know in particular 
which makes this difference between the variance based and skewness based approach (the 
dashed arrows with the mystery box in Fig. \ref{fig_pedag_taildep}A-B). 

<!--p5: But how skewness is different than variance-measure? Is there 
any mechanism working in the background that is responsible 
for changing skewness while keeping the overall correlation same? Therefore, we think may be it is "tail-association".(Fig. 2C-D)

What is tail-association? How it could chenge the skewness of the 
community on aggregated sp. level? and then relate it to the stability 
intuitively: LT association means crashing the whole community.-->

A recent study [@Ghosh_copula]
shows tail associations between local quantities affects the 
skewness of spatially averaged
productivity. Likewise, we anticipate the tail-association between 
individual time-series could be responsible for changing skewness on 
an aggregate level. Tail association means a stronger correlation between two 
variables at their extremes than moderate values. If two random variables (say, 
time series for two individual species from a community) are more 
associated in their smaller values than higher then they are having 
stronger 'lower-tail' association (Fig. \ref{fig_pedag_taildep}C) indicating 
both species are going synchronously rare than abundant 
(as shown in Fig. \ref{fig_pedag_cv2_skw}A). Similarly, 
if variables are more associated in their higher values than smaller
then they are having stronger 'upper-tail' association (Fig. \ref{fig_pedag_taildep}D)
indicating both species are going synchronously abundant than rare 
(as shown in Fig. \ref{fig_pedag_cv2_skw}B). A finite 
difference between lower- and upper-tail association indicates 'tail-asymmetry' 
between interspecific response over the years. Tail-asymmetry is known to
have significant effect on population-extinction risk [ERC_ecosphere]
and hence could be related to stability on the population, community and even ecosystem level.
For example, the lower tail association could cause the community 
likely to crash at once - making the community less stable.

<!--p6: Our objectives:
(Q1) Could we find an overall tail association (L/U) in a community which arises because of  
synchronous/ compensatory species interaction? [answer by pscor]
(Q2) If we do, then how does tail-association pattern explain the underlying mechanism 
affecting the overall skewness of the community? More specifically, could this
assymetric sp. interaction explain the community stability which we might miss 
with the classic variance ratio method? [answer: Fig 1b hidden box revealed]
We will answer these Qs with two grassland community datasets: Hays & Konza.-->

In this paper, we will explore the potential for asymmetric tail associations 
to assess nonlinear interactions among species in a community and to 
unravel any hidden mechanism - not detected by the usual variance ratio approach -
for stabilizing (or destabilizing) a community. Specifically, we will address 
the following sets of questions: (Q1) In a community, could we find 
asymmetric tail associations (lower and/ or upper) that arise because of 
synchronous/ compensatory interaction between species? Do those interactions 
make the community overall lower-tail or overall upper-tail asymmetric? 
(Q2) If we do, then how does the tail association pattern 
explain the underlying mechanism affecting the overall 
skewness of the community? To be specific, we seek for 
a route map to predict stability for an overall tail-asymmetric 
community, based on a 'skewness ratio' approach. For (Q1), we use partial 
Spearman correlation measures [@Ghosh_copula; ERC_ecosphere] focusing 
on the extremes of pairwise species interaction. For (Q2) we disentangle
the overall contribution in variance-/ skewness-ratio 
into two distinct parts: one from the usual correlation and the 
other from the tail association. We tested our theoretical 
framework for assessing stability measure and detecting tail-asymmetry for 
a community with two long-term grassland datasets: basal cover data of vascular 
plant species from Hays and plant species composition data from Konza prairie. 
To our knowledge, though the potential of tail association in population 
ecology [@Ghosh_copula; ERC_ecosphere] has been recently studied, using it 
on the community level to assessing variability-stability relationship remains 
unexplored. Our essential goal is to advance the idea that tail
associations may also be important in this context. Our questions are 
also an important step for predicting net productivity, 
community reorganization, etc. through monitoring skewness over years.


<!--idea: 
- can we make specific outcome oriented 
community by choosing species or a cluster of sp.?
- could change in skewness/ phi_s indicate species reordering 
similar to that of early warning signal 
used for regime shift?-->

<!--Defining partial Spearman correlation: measure of tail-asymmetry-->
To answer Q1 from \nameref{Introduction}, we need a tool to measure the tail asymmetry between 
interacting species over years in a grassland community that is intended to study. We used 
the *partial Spearman correlation* approach (first introduced in @Ghosh_copula) to 
estimate the association between a pair of interacting species' time-series, i.e., whether 
they are strongly correlated in their common good/ bad years (synchronous dynamics) or 
one species' abundance in certain 'good' years limits the growth for the 
other (compensatory dynamics). From a data perspective, consider 
a set of two variables, i.e. time series for any two species,
$\{ u_t, v_t\}, t = 1, 2, \ldots , T$. If $\{ \bar{x_t}, \bar{y_t}\}$ 
are the	corresponding ranks of $\{ u_t, v_t\}$, then a scatter plot with 
the "normalized rank" $\{ x_t, y_t\} = \{ \bar{x_t}, \bar{y_t}\} / (T+1)$ 
reveals the associated dependence pattern 
hidden in the original timeseries of $\{ u_t, v_t\}$. 
This scatter plot of $\{ x_t, y_t\}$, confined within a unit square, 
is known as a bivariate *copula* plot.
*Copula* is a statistical tool tailored to 
estimate tail-dependence and can isolate the dependence 
information from its marginals [@joe2014_dependence; 
@nelsen2006_copula; @MaiScherer2017]. However, computationally 
low-cost non-parametric approaches are available to estimate tail association
in the either extremes for this *copula* plot [@Ghosh_copula]. Following we will give a brief 
description of such a non-parametric measure of tail-association.

First, we define the *partial Spearman correlaion* for a given 
species pair time series ($u(t), v(t)$) as follows;

\begin{equation}
\cor_{l_b,u_b}(u,v) = \frac{\sum (x(t)-\mean(x))(y(t)-\mean(y))}{(T-1)\sqrt{\var(x) \var(y)}},\label{PartialSpearmanEq}
\end{equation}
\noindent where $x$ and $y$ are the normalized ranks of 
$u$ and $v$, respectlively, as stated before. Sample means 
and variances are computed using all the data but the sum is computed only
over the $t$ such that $x(t)+y(t) > 2l_b$ and $x(t)+y(t)<2u_b$ (i.e. colored data points lying in 
between two bounds as in Fig. \ref{fig_pedag_taildep}C-D). The partial Spearman correlation 
is the contribution of those colored data points between bounds in the total Spearman
correlation of $u$ and $v$. For an asymmetric relationship 
between a species-pair, association in one extreme of their copula plot would be
stronger than the other extreme. For example, Fig. \ref{fig_pedag_taildep}C has a 
stronger partial Spearman correlation between the red points in the lower portion 
than the blue points in the upper part, while Fig. \ref{fig_pedag_taildep}D shows 
the opposite trend. 


The quantity $\cor_{0,0.5}(u,v)-\cor_{0.5,1}(u,v)$ is a way to estimate asymmetry of tail
associations between $u$ and $v$. 
$\cor_{0,0.5}(u,v)-\cor_{0.5,1}(u,v)$ represents the amount by which partial Spearman 
correlation is stronger for the points lying in the lower tail (i.e. 
below the dashed diagonal $x+y=1$ in Fig. \ref{fig_pedag_taildep}C-D) than the upper tail (i.e. 
above the dashed diagonal $x+y=1$ in Fig. \ref{fig_pedag_taildep}C-D). We will represent 
$\cor_{l}-\cor_{u}$ for the shorthand of $\cor_{0,0.5}(u,v)-\cor_{0.5,1}(u,v)$ here 
afterwards. A non-zero value of $\cor_{l}-\cor_{u}$ means tail-asymmetry between the time series of
two species - whether they are synchronizing over years 
or competing with each other. <!--***DAN: please double check this statement-->
For synchronized species-pair, a positive $\cor_{l}-\cor_{u}$ value signifies stronger lower 
tail association (Fig. \ref{fig_pedag_taildep}C) of two 
positively correlated species, whereas a negative value means stronger
upper tail association (Fig. \ref{fig_pedag_taildep}D). Though the aforementioned notion of 
tail-asymmetry measure is constructed for positively correlated species pair keeping in mind, it 
is possible to extend the idea for negatively correlated species. When the 
species are competing (i.e. overall correlation is negative), we can take any one species time 
series as negative (so that now species are positively correlated) and 
make a similar plot as in Fig. \ref{fig_pedag_taildep}C or D (depending on which 
species we are reversing). Species for reversal can be chosen arbitrarily, 
hence only the magnitude, not the sign of tail-asymmetry 
$\cor_{l}-\cor_{u}$ is considered for competing species pair. Therefore, a finite 
value of $|\cor_{l}-\cor_{u}|$ would indicate asymmetric tail association 
between two corresponding species time series $\{ u_t, v_t\}$. In particular, 
the magnitude for compensatory and magnitude as well as the sign for synchronous 
(positive for lower tail and negative for upper tail) dynamics can answer the 
first part of (Q1). 

<!--corl - coru in community context, count on L, U (+ve correlation only)-->
From a community perspective, it is possible to determine if the community as a whole
shows asymmetric tail association and if yes then what is its underlying 
nature - overall lower tail or upper-tail asymmetry. To explore this, consider a 
community with $n$ number of species subdivided 
into three categories: *common* species (present for most of the years), *rare* 
species (only occurs once or twice) and the rest as *intermediate* ones. Throughout our study, 
we assume a $n$-species-community comprised of $T$-years long observations for 
$(n-1)$ *common* species and 
one *pseudo*-species (aggregated time-series 
for *rare* and *intermediate* categories). For
such community, there are $p=n(n-1)/2$ number of unique 
pair-wise interspecific interactions possible. First, for 
each of these species-pairs, we construct the scatter plot with 
the normalized rank of corresponding time-series (i.e. the *copula* plot)
<!-- omitted as of now: 
and test their 
independence using `BiCopIndTest` function from `VineCopula` package implemented in `R`. If 
independence is rejected ($0.05$ significance level), then we proceed to estimate--> 
and measured tail-asymmetry ($\cor_{l}-\cor_{u}$) as described above. For positively 
correlated species-pair, we count how many are with the stronger 
lower-tail (or upper-tail) association, $n_L$ (or $n_U$). These 
numbers along with the sum of each asymmetric 
tail-association estimate, $A_{tot} = \sum_p (\cor_{l}-\cor_{u})$ for 
positively correlated pair, can give us an idea about the 
overall nature of tail-asymmetry 
within the community that answers the second part of (Q1).

<!--omitted as of now: Significance tests for individual and overall asymmetry, tailsignif.R, binomial_sigtest.R
At present not shown, because we want to consider all interactions: weekest to strongest.

Tail-asymmetry could be weaker on individual species-pair, but on an aggregate level can make 
the community strongly tail-asymmetric. To test significantly stronger 
association in one of its extreme tail for a given species-pair, we simulate $10000$ made-up 
species pair with same Spearman correlation but removing their tail-asymmetry. If 
estimated tail-asymmetry $\cor_{l}-\cor_{u}$ on given data lies outside 
the $95\%$ confidence interval of the ones estimated with $10000$ surrogated data, then 
we consider the tail-asymmetric relationship is significant for that species-pair. 
On a community level, we calculated the fraction of significant species-pair among all correlated 
pairs considered (overall significance on the community level, $C_s$). We also perform a binomial 
test to check whether the community shows significantly stronger lower-tail (or upper-tail) association.

      - brief intro about the usual way to measure community variability (variance ratio method)
      - then introduce skewness ratio in analogy with variance ratio
      - separate the contributions from tail association and usual correlation (Pearson)

-->

To answer (Q2) from \nameref{Introduction}, our approach was to assess the effect 
of tail-asymmetry between species-pairs that was not accounted for 
classic variance ratio approach. Variability 
through time, be it for individual or for total community biomass, is a key component to
measure the stability [@ives1999stability]. Following we
briefly discuss about the classic variance ratio metric which is generally 
used to predict the community-stability [@schluter1984variance]. 


<!--short theoretical background to calculate phi_cv with variance ratio method, and its interpretation-->
Consider a community with $n$ number of species where individual species biomass 
or productivity ($x_i(t); i = 1, 2, \ldots, n$) being monitored 
through $t = 1, 2, \ldots, T$ years. Mean biomass time series is denoted as 
$\mu_i = \bar{x_i}$ for $i^{th}$ individual species whereas interaction between species
is represented by the covariance $v_{ij} = \cov(x_i,x_j)$. $v_{ij} = 0$ implies
independent fluctuation. On an aggregated scale, the total productivity, mean and the variance 
are represented as $x_{tot} = \sum_{i} x_i$, $\mu_{tot} = \sum_{i} \mu_i$ 
and $v_{tot} = \sum_{i,j}v_{ij}$, respectively. These quantities quantify
squared coefficient of variation ($CV_{com}^2 = v_{tot}/\mu_{tot}^2$) that measures 
the variability of the said community [@pimm1984complexity]. If interspecific 
interaction makes a community more variable compared to independent species
fluctuation, then the community is considered more stable. In mathematical natation, 
this stability index is represented as the classic 
variance ratio, $\phi_{cv}$ ($= CV_{com}^2/CV_{ind}^2 =  \sum_{i,j}v_{ij}/ \sum_{i} v_{ii}$). 
When $\phi_{cv}>1$, community is highly variable compared to a community where species are fluctuating 
independently and randomly. Species with compensatory dynamics (fluctuating time-series 
in anti-phase) makes a community more stable (i.e., $\phi_{cv}<1$) due to different 
functional responses from different functional group of species within the community. 
On the other hand, synchronized fluctuation between species results higher $\phi_{cv}(>1)$ 
and makes community less stable towards 
environmental perturbation compared to an independent community.

<!--alternative measure of stability: based on skewness-->
We here propose an alternative measure of 
stability for a $n$-species community. Accounting for the effect due to 
extreme environmental perturbation, it is reasonable to consider
how much the mean and the median would differ for total productivity of a 
community throughout the years. In such case, we represent 
the skewness for a community as
$S_{com}=\sum_{i,j,k}m_{ijk}/\sum_{i,j,k}v_{ijk}^{3/2} = m_{tot}/v_{tot}^{3/2}$, where 
$m_{tot}$ is the 3$^{rd}$ central moment of the temporal distribution 
for total biomass of the community. If all the species within 
that community behave as independent entities (i.e. no interaction between species), then the skewness 
for an independent community would be 
$S_{ind} = \sum_{i}m_{iii}/\sum_{i}v_{i}^{3/2}$. Therefore, we define the index for
skewness-based change in a community $\phi_{s} = S_{com}/ S_{ind}$ similar to that 
of the variance ratio metric, $\phi_{cv}$. It is trivial to show the relationship
between these two stability indices as $\phi_s = (m_{tot}/\sum_im_{iii})(1/\phi_{cv}^{3/2})$.

<!--interpretation for phi_s and stability-->
Unlike $\phi_{cv}$, $\phi_s$ can be positive, $0$ or negative depending on the 
signs of the skewnesses from the concerned community and its 
independent analog. $\phi_s >1$ indicates that
the community biomass is more positively (or more negatively) skewed
than it would have been if the species have no interactions with each other.
The opposite scenario - i.e., when the community with interacting species shows less positive
or less negative skewness than would be expected if there was no interactions - represents 
$\phi_s$ to be within the range $(0,1)$. $\phi_s \approx 0$ means skewness is eliminated by the 
interactions of the species within the community, i.e., high productivity of some species 
for some years are balanced by its proportional drop in productivity 
for other years or by other species for those same years. <!--***Shya:please review this line, am I right here? 
is this similar as of phi_cv < 1 for compensatory dynamics?--> A negative $\phi_s$ indicates 
interspefic interactions at the extreme values can alter the skewness (i.e. changing its sign) of a 
community-biomass distribution over years than it would have been expected without any interactions. 
<!--for example, see explore_phis.R where a left-tail dep. community 
with slightly right skewed marginals make phi_s -ve.-->


<!--how phi_s and phi_cv are different?-->
We recommend to use both these indices ($\phi_{cv}$ and $\phi_s$) to get 
a complete picture to predict the stability of the community. It is possible
to underestimate the stability status of the community if we only
depend on the $\phi_{cv}$, which is a correlation 
(i.e. normalized covariance) based measure. $\phi_s$, on the other hand, takes 
the extreme values or tail asymmetry between interspecific 
response into account to assess the change in community structure
over time. Therefore, two communities with similar $\phi_{cv}$ could have two drastically 
different $\phi_s$ and interpretation of stability if we consider the change of skewness as an indicator 
of community-change (examples with real data are shown in \nameref{Results}). For example, consider 
two communities $C_A$ and $C_B$ with equal number of species. It is 
possible that the majority of species in $C_A$ show very low productivity for some 
years whereas those in $C_B$ are extremely abundant for some years, though
their overall pairwise correlation remains same. In such case, $C_A$ and $C_B$ 
should show more or less same $\phi_{cv}$ but 
different $\phi_s$, particularly $\phi_s$ for community $C_A$ 
should be less than that for community $C_B$, i.e., $0<\phi_{s,C_A}<1 < \phi_{s,C_B}$. 
<!--***DAN: double check this statement, this is theoretically I expect but in Fig.1 with madeup extreme tail dep community phi_s are same though S_com are different-->
To explain the theoretical basis of such difference 
between $\phi_{cv}$ and $\phi_s$, we make partition for the overall contribution 
in stability metric into two distict parts - due to correlation and
due to tail association for extreme values between interspecific response, as follows. 

<!--partition between correlation and tail association effect in phi_s, phi_cv-->
As we have mentioned earlier, the skewness of a community ($S_{com}$) is related 
with its independent analog ($S_{ind}$) by the scaling factor $\phi_s$ that can be considered 
as a measure of community-change over time. This $\phi_s$ can have two distinct independent
contributions: $\phi_{s,cor}$ (due to only correlation) 
and $\phi_{s,ta}$ (due to tail-asymmetry), i.e., $\phi_s = \phi_{s,cor} \times \phi_{s,ta}$. 
One can consider $\phi_{s,cor}$ as a factor by which skewness of an independent-community 
($S_{ind}$, skewness for species having no interactions) changes to the skewness of 
the community when species show correlated fluctuations but no asymmetric tail-association ($S_{nta}$), 
i.e., $S_{ind} = \phi_{s,cor} \times S_{nta}$. From now on, we will mention the later type of community 
as 'tail-symmetric' community where interspecific response showed no 
stronger correlation in either tail. Theoretically, one can make this tail-symmetric community 
from the given community matrix by removing the asymmetric tail-association 
among species but keeping the pairwise Pearson correlation same (upto sampling variation) via 
algorithm stated in Appendix \ref{SI-alg_pp_com}. Now, if the interspecific response 
are more correlated in their lower or higher values (i.e., asymmetric 
tail-association) over years, then the skewness for the tail-symmetric community 
would change by a factor $\phi_{s,ta}$ such that $S_{com} = \phi_{s,ta} \times S_{nta}$.
We can also consider the corresponding analog for variance ratio metric, i.e., 
$\phi_{cv} = \phi_{cv,cor} \times \phi_{cv,ta}$ but as co-variance does not incorporate the effect
for extreme values, $\phi_{cv,ta}$ would be $\approx 1$. The relations between independent, tail-symmetric 
and the given community with all these metrics are shown as a schematic diagram in Fig. \ref{fig_schematic_box}. 
<!--What to expect for the values of $\phi_s$'s with two different kinds of tail-asymmetry?-->
For a given community where most of the species showed stronger correlation in 
lower values (i.e. stronger lower tail association with $A_{tot}>0$), one can 
expect the change in skewness would be in the order $S_{com} < S_{nta}$ 
and $\phi_{s,ta} < \phi_{s,cor}$ as lower tail association 
tends to suppress the skewness (Fig. \ref{fig_pedag_cv2_skw}C). If the 
community showed stronger tail-association for the higher values of 
species-time series (i.e. $A_{tot}<0$), skewness should change in 
reverse order, i.e., $S_{com} > S_{nta}$ with $\phi_{s,ta} > \phi_{s,cor}$.
This anticipitation is consistent with the fact that upper tail 
association tends to increase the skewness (Fig. \ref{fig_pedag_cv2_skw}D). The 
stronger the tail-asymmetry for the 
interspecific response within the community (i.e. higher $|A_{tot}|$), the larger would be 
the difference between $\phi_{s,cor}$ and $\phi_{s,ta}$. We summarize the 
difference between classic variance ratio approach and our proposed 
skewness ratio approach in Fig. \ref{fig_method_box} that can help to answer (Q2).

The complete reproducible workflow 
for this project is available at https://github.com/sghosh89/Copula_spaceavg. Following 
we will present the results from the analyses with 
two examplary long-term community data described in Appendix \ref{SI-Data}.

# Results\label{Results}

We here present the results from the study carried out with two long-term
grassland community data sets: basal cover data (1932-1972)
of mixed grass priarie near Hays, KS and Konza prairie 
percent cover data (1983-2018) (for details see
Appendix \ref{SI-Data}). 

<!--Results for Q1
(Q1) In a community, could we find 
asymmetric tail associations (lower and/ or upper) that arise because of 
synchronous/ compensatory interaction between species? 

Do those interactions make the community overall lower-tail or 
overall upper-tail asymmetric? 

For Q1: plot with hays and knz corl-coru (Fig 4, panels a,b)-->

For each unique pairwise species combination from 
each of two examplary communities, we computed lower and upper tail 
association (*partial Spearman correlation* method) between 
species over years. The difference (i.e. lower minus upper tail 
association estimates) are presented in 
Fig. \ref{fig_CorlmCoru}A for Hays and B for Konza. 
We found both positively correlated (synchronous) and negatively 
correlated (compensatory) species pairs showed 
asymmetric tail association. For Hays, majority of species pair interaction showed 
stronger lower tail association ($n_L$ = 70) than stronger 
upper tail association ($n_U$ = 40). Negatively correlated pairs,indicated by green dots, 
were excluded while counting $n_L$ and $n_U$ since the magnitude not the sign matters 
for tail-asymmetry with competitive species interaction (see \ref{Methods} for details). 
As the number of interspecific interaction with lower tail asymmetry,$n_L$ was nearly double 
than the number of interspecific interaction with upper tail asymmetry,$n_U$ for Hays, 
the overall tail-asymmetry estimate, $A_{tot}$ was strongly positive, $6.0842$, <!--caution, 
not autolinked, I copied from fig. legend-->suggecting Hays community was strongly 
lower tail asymmetric for the $1932-1972$ study period (Fig. \ref{fig_CorlmCoru}A). 
On the other hand, for Konza (Fig. \ref{fig_CorlmCoru}B), majority of species pair 
interaction showed stronger upper tail association ($n_U$ = 82) than stronger 
upper tail association ($n_L$ = 70), though the difference between $n_L$ and $n_U$ 
was not that apperent as of Hays. Total asymmetry $A_{tot}$ estimates for Konza
was slightly negative, $-1.3496$, <!--caution, 
not autolinked, I copied from fig. legend-->making the Konza community 
overall upper tail asymmetric. These observations answered (Q1).

<!--Results for Q2

(Q2) How does the tail association pattern 
explain the underlying mechanism affecting the overall 
skewness of the community? To be specific, we seek for 
a route map to predict stability for an overall tail-asymmetric 
community, based on a 'skewness ratio' approach.

For Q2: Fig. 5-->

To answer (Q2), we followed the route map of monitoring the 
change of variance as well as of skewness as 
shown in Fig. \ref{fig_result_box}A-D. We tracked the changes 
through three states of the given community (Hays and Konza); they 
are: the independent community (species having no interaction), 
tail-symmetric community (species with correlation but no tail-association), 
and the actual community (species having correlation as well 
as tail association). For Hays, variance ratio $\phi_{cv}$ was less than 1 
indicating stable community than the independent 
fluctuation (Fig. \ref{fig_result_box}A). For Konza, $\phi_{cv}$ concluded 
the same (Fig. \ref{fig_result_box}C). Both communities have 
$\phi_{cv} \approx \phi_{cv,cor}$ as tail-association did not contribute
to the change in variance (i.e., $\phi_{cv,ta} \approx 1$). But our proposed 
approach detected the difference between the two communities. Skewness ratio 
$\phi_s = 0.2911$ for Hays was much less than 1, and mainly affected by 
the tail-asymmetric contribution as $\phi_{s} \approx \phi_{s,ta}$ and 
$\phi_{s,cor} \approx 1$ (Fig. \ref{fig_result_box}B). This observation was consistent with our 
earlier finding (i.e. answer for second part of Q1) that species in Hays 
showed stronger lower tail association on overall community level. Lower tail association 
makes a community more negatively skewed making total productivity *less stable* as 
species could crash altogether unexpectedly. On the other hand, for Konza, skewness ratio 
$\phi_s = 7.3811$ was much higher than 1, meaning a community 
with consistently high productivity - so *more stable*. This finding was also 
consistent with the fact that species in Konza showed major upper-tail 
association in our earlier findings. Also note, as total tail-asymmetry, $A_{tot}$, for Konza was not 
as large as $A_{tot}$ for Hays, there was slight difference between 
$\phi_{s,ta}$ and $\phi_{s,cor}$ for Konza. Fig. \ref{fig_result_box}(E-H) is a 
pictorial representation of the summary result shown 
in Fig. \ref{fig_result_box}(A-D) for squared coefficient of 
variation, $CV^2$, and skewness, $S$, for 
actual community and independent community compared
to $10000$ tail-symmetric surrogate 
communities we made up via algorithm stated in Appendix \ref{SI-alg_pp_com}. This 
example with two community datasets showed two tail-asymmetric communities could have 
same variance ratio but contrasting skewness ratio because of opposing tail 
asymmetric nature they had - which answered (Q2).
